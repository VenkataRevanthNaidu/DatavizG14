<h2>Overview Of Visualization</h2>
 <a>
  By placing data in a visual context, such as maps or graphs, data visualization helps us understand what it means. This makes the data more natural to understand for the human mind, making it easier to see trends, patterns, and outliers in vast data sets. 
 </a>
<h2>First_Visualization</h2>
<h3><center>ScatterPlot</center></h3>
 The First Visualization in our website describes the hotspots in Baltimore city based on the 
probability and intensity of the crimes. The main goal is to analyze the impact of selecting 
hotspots based only on crime Probability vs. Intensity scatter plot. To visualiz
e this scatter plot, we took 166 neighborhoods, calculated the 
probability and intensity in each neighborhood, and picked the crime with the highest probability. Intensity 
is nothing but the total number of crimes that have been occurred in a neighborhood per year.
 Python is used for calculating the probability and intensity. On the X-axis probability and on the
 Y-axis intensity are displayed. In the coming weeks, we will apply styles. The visualization is done for only
 one year; we will complete the plots for the remaining five years and apply drop-down to the required year.</a>

  if (name === "viewof genre_option") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-viewof-genre_option-a2de470c"));
  return ["selected_movies"].includes(name);
});

<h2>Second_visualization<h2>
<h2><center>Street Level Map Visualization of crime</center></h2>
 <a>We applied the Street-level Geospatial map of Baltimore city and displayed the crime that has more probability of occurring and the intensity of the crime in each neighborhood in Baltimore city. We presented all the neighborhoods that are in the Scatterplot in Geospatial Map. By clicking on the location, the crime that has occurred more number of times, Probability, and Intensity of the crimes will be displayed. To get the map of Baltimore, some Java scripts libraries are used, namely Leaflet, Open Street map, and Map box. The same process will
 be done for the following five years, and some styles will also be included in the coming weeks.</a>
